Requirements:

You need the gnet2 library including development headers.

These packages are called libgnet2.0-0 and libgnet2.0-dev (debian) 
  or gnet2 and gnet2-devel, or just gnet2 or similar.


If you can't find packages, get the source code from http://www.gnetlibrary.org


If libgnet is correctly installed, running

    pkg-config --cflags gnet-2.0

should not result in an error.


Gnet2 depends on glib2, which you probably have installed already. You
 might need the libglib2.0-dev (or glib2-devel) package though.



After that is taken care of, type

    make

     or

    make static


to build the program.


    make install   (as root)

will install it into /usr/local/bin. If you want it somewhere else, just copy it there
  or edit the makefile
