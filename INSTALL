Requirements:

You need the gnet library (libgnet) including development headers (libgnet-dev).
If you can't find packages, get the source code from http://www.gnetlibrary.org


If libgnet is correctly installed, running

    gnet-config --cflags

should not result in an error.


After that is taken care of, type

    make

     or

    make static

to build the program.


    make install   (as root)

will install it into /usr/local/bin. If you want it somewhere else, just copy it there.
