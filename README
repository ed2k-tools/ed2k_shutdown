Description:
------------

ed2k_shutdown is a little utility that cleanly shuts down an
eDonkey2000 or overnet command line client. It does so by using
the GUI-core protocol via a tcp connections to the so-called
'aport' on which the core listens for a GUI connection.

In other words: The 'core' must

(a) be configured properly (a username+password must be set up)

(b) be listening on the 'aport' (default is: 4663) for GUI
    connections (which it does only if it has been started with
    the '-' parameter).

(c) have been started with the '!' parameter as last parameter
    (which effectively blocks all input via the command line;
    if this is not the case, the core will only shutdown after
    the next command input)

(d) not be connected to a GUI when you run the 'shutdown' program


If all that is the case, you can shutdown the core via

ed2k_shutdown <host> <aport> <user> <pass>


Enjoy!
