Description:
------------

ed2k_shutdown is a little utility that cleanly shuts down an
eDonkey2000 or overnet command line client. It does so by using
the GUI-core protocol via a tcp connections to the so-called
'aport' on which the core listens for a GUI connection.

In other words: The 'core' must

(a) be configured properly (a username+password must be set up)

(b) be listening on the 'aport' (default is: 4663) for GUI
    connections (which it does only if it has been started with
    the '-g' parameter (v51.2 and later) or the '-' parameter
    (v50.1 and earlier)).

(c) have been started with the '-l' parameter as last parameter
    (which effectively blocks all input via the command line;
    if this is not the case, the core will only shutdown after
    the next command input) (core v51.2 and later), or the
    '!' parameter (core v50.1 and earlier)

(d) not be connected to a GUI when you run this program


If all that is the case, you can shutdown the core via

  ed2k_shutdown <host> <aport> <user> <pass>

or send an advanced command with:

  ed2k_shutdown <host> <aport> <user> <pass> <command in quotes>


Examples:

  ed2k_shutdown localhost 4663 bob bobpass

  ed2k_shutdown 192.168.0.9 7777 joe joepass "dumax 0 10" 


Enjoy!
